## Hi there 👋

I have been developing **serverless** ☁️ backends/ micro-services/ etl-pipelines on AWS for more than a year. These days, learning AWS infra migrations and managing/monitoring security on AWS.

* I love to watch NBA and play basketball, Stephen Curry is my favourite ❤️ player.
* I have passion for trucking 🚛 so i play sometimes _**euro truck simulator 2**_ on weekends.
* binge watch uncle BOBs lessons.
